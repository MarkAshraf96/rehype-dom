## What is this?

This is like [`rehype`][rehype] but for browsers.

## When should I use this?

Use this package when you want to use `rehype` in browsers.
There are some limitations: see [the monorepo readme][rehype-dom] for info on
when (not) to use `rehype-dom`.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-dom
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {rehypeDom} from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-dom@6'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {rehypeDom} from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-dom@6?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our page `example.html` contains:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>Example</title>
<body>
<script type="module">
  import {rehypeDom} from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-dom@7?bundle'

  const file = await rehypeDom().process('<h1>Hi <del>Mars</del>Venus!</h1>')

  document.body.innerHTML = String(file)
</script>
```

â€¦opening it in a browser renders the following in `<body>`:

```html
<h1>Hi <del>Mars</del>Venus!</h1>
```

## API

This package exports the identifier [`rehypeDom`][api-rehype-dom].
There is no default export.

### `rehypeDom()`

Create a new unified processor that already uses
[`rehype-dom-parse`][rehype-dom-parse] and
[`rehype-dom-stringify`][rehype-dom-stringify].

You can add more plugins with `use`.
See [`unified`][unified] for more information.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: the default of the `fragment` option is `true` in this package,
> which is different from the value in `rehype`, because it makes more sense in
> browsers.

## Examples

### Example: passing options

When you use `rehype-dom-parse` or `rehype-dom-stringify` manually you can pass
options directly to them with `use`.
Because both plugins are already used in `rehype`, thatâ€™s not possible.
To define options for them, you can instead pass options to `data`:

```js
import {rehypeDom} from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-dom@6?bundle'

const file = await rehypeDom()
  .data('settings', {fragment: false})
  .process('<!doctype html>' + document.documentElement.outerHTML)

console.log(String(file))
```

## Syntax

HTML is parsed and serialized according to what a browser supports (which
*should* be WHATWG HTML).

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree used in rehype is [hast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

It also registers `Settings` with `unified`.
If youâ€™re passing options with `.data('settings', â€¦)`, make sure to import this
package somewhere in your types, as that registers the fields.

```js
/**
 * @typedef {import('rehype-dom')}
 */

import {unified} from 'unified'

// @ts-expect-error: `thisDoesNotExist` is not a valid option.
unified().data('settings', {thisDoesNotExist: false})
```

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`rehype-dom@^7`, compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

Use of `rehype-dom` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack if dangerous content is used and the result is used with the actual DOM.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to solve that.
